   <p>There are two buttons that control the elevator.</p>
   <p>You press them, but they don't seem to do anything</p>
   <p>You look closer at the panel. There's an input box</p>
   <p>It seems you need a code to operate the elevator</p>
   <p>There's seems to be something written on the wall...</p>
