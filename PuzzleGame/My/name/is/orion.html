   <p>The legend of Orion, the great hunter, and the scorpion that killed him:</p>
   <p>Orion, the mightest hunter that ever lived, master over all creatures</p>
   <p>became arrogant, and prideful, insulting Juno</p>
   <p>She sent a scorpion to kill him.</p>
   <p>It lay on the path. Orion's dogs made no notice.</p>
   <p>As Orion trod upon it, it stung him, and he died.</p>
   <p>Diana, who was in love with Orion, commemorated his life,</p>
   <p>raising him to heaven.</p>
   <p>To pass the gate, name:</p>
   <p>The hunter's right shoulder</p>
   <p>The great dog's collar</p>
   <p>The heart of the beast</p>
