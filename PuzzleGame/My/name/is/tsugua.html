   <p id='null'>Hello August</p>
   <p id='null'>Welcome back.</p>
   <p id='null'>I'll admit this now... I've lied to you</p>
   <p id='null'>Partially.</p>
   <p id='null'>What I said about this world is true</p>
   <p id='null'>but the exit is not a physical place.</p>
   <p id='null'>I'm sure you've guessed by now, but to leave a simulation,</p>
   <p id='null'>there's always a certain keyword,</p>
   <p id='null'>a kill-switch, as it would be called,</p>
   <p id='null'>without which you would remain inside the simulation, even upon "death".</p>
   <p id='null'>See the URL? It has the name of the simulation, "Soliloquy", as its title.</p>
   <p id='null'>Next is the type of simulation; a puzzle game.</p>
   <p id='null'>The following words are the important ones.</p>
   <p id='null'>They are the power of the simulated to access the simulation.</p>
   <p id='null'>Each puzzle is a seperate location.</p>
   <p id='null'>You've already been using them to go from place to place.</p>
   <p id='null'>Everyone does.</p>
   <p id='null'>But what most people don't know is that those words can also lead <em>out</em> of the simulation.</p>
   <p id='null'>You'll know you're out when you're no longer in soliloquy</p>
   <p id='null'>Best of luck.</p>
   <p id='null'>August</p>
   <!--By the way, You, the Player, can always navigate away from Soliloquy, but August will not be freed
   unless he exits from inside the simulation.-->
